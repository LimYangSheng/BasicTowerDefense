Extra features
1. Object pooling implementation for bullet game objects
This ensures a smoother game play as less CPU time is spent on creation and destruction of bullet game objects.

2. Waves of enemies
This gives players an objective to work towards when playing the game.
It incentivise them to play for a higher score.
The inclusion of waves also make the game progressively harder.

3. Upgrading turrets
Players can choose to either build more turrets or upgrade their turrets in order to progress through the waves.
This adds on more complexity to the game where the uncertain outcomes attract players to play again.

This adds a challenging factor to the game as players now have a limited amount of resources to tackle the game.

6. Game over screen with a reset button
Players can have a smoother transition between games.
